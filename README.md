## Workbench for Nomad and Kubernetes

Uses rust as language for the tests
Spin and WasmEdge as high level Wasm-runtimes.
Modified [k3s](https://github.com/voima-eetu/k3s/tree/logging-k3s) as Kubernetes distribution, 
And Nomad.

[hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) as bench.

Functions are originally from [ddps-labs](https://github.com/ddps-lab/serverless-faas-workbench/tree/master) and they have been adapted to Rust by [@korvoj](https://github.com/wasm-orchestration/wasm-orchestration-scripts) (mainly spin) and me (WasmEdge).
